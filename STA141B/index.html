		<p>This course focuses on the fundamental concepts of data technologies used in data analysis. Specifically, we mainly used Python and Jupyter Notebook. Our analysis used data from traditional databases and Web APIs. Please see some of the projects I did below. </p>

	<h3>Projects</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Trump in the News</strong></li>
	<p>In a team with three others (<a href="https://noashadmon.github.io/">Noa Shadmon</a>, <a href="https://rpbradystadavis.github.io/rpbrady/">Ryan Brady</a>, <a href="https://shichew.github.io">Shirley Chew</a>), we analyzed various news outlets such as <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics">ABC News</a>, <a href="http://www.breitbart.com">Breitbart</a>, and more to see how article titles protray the President of the United States, Donald Trump. First, we webscraped the news outlets for the titles and then we used natural language processing techniques to analyze the titles. We utilized packages such as Textblob and NLTK in Python. We also did sentiment analysis on polarity and subjectivity of the titles and nounphrases. 
	</p>
	Our process, analysis, and final result is published <a href="https://noashadmon.github.io/sta141bfinal/">here</a>.

	<li><strong>Doomsday Algorithm</strong></li>
	  <p>Doomsday Algorithm was implemented in Python to count the number of Friday the 13's and to analyze the occurances of birthdays in 1978</p>
	  See the algorithm and analysis <a href="projects/assignment1.html">here</a>.
	<p></p>
	<li><strong>Image Processing Basics and Singular Value Decomposition</strong></li>
	<p>Given an image, the color channels were manipulated to show different colors. Then I implemented singular value decomposition to reduce the number of bits as well as maintaining visibility.</p>
	  An example of a cat image manipulation is shown <a href="projects/assignment2.html">here</a>.
	<p></p>
	<li><strong>US Department of Agriculture Fruits and Vegetable Analysis</strong></li>
	<p>A various amount of fruits and vegetables were saved in Excel files. After reading each file in and extracted neccessary data, I performed analysis on the food such as finding the most and least expensive fruit.</p> 
	  To see details of the data extraction and food analysis, the file is located <a href="projects/hw3.html">here</a>.
	<p></p>
	<li><strong>Data Analysis using the USDA Food Composition Databases Web API</strong></li>
	<p>From a given list of food, I used the USDA Food Composition Database Web API to grab neccessary information based on a search. After collecting the data, I did an analysis on which food provides the best combination of yield, price, and nutrition.</p>
	  Find out which food has the best combination <a href="projects/assignment4.html">here</a>.
