		<p>STA 141A is an introduction to data analysis and visualization using R. The data analysis included clean and complex data. With complex data, we cleaned the data using regular expressions. Some of the projects from this course can be seen below. </p>

	<h3>Projects</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Linear and Logistic Regression in R</strong></li>
	  <p>Given a dataset, I performed bootstrap linear regression to find the best model. Using bootstrap helps creates better results as we'e randomly sampling multiple times. Logistic regression was performed a dataset for flowers to see how well the model performs. We split the data into testing and training set to see how well the model classifies certain flower data. </p>

	<p></p>
	<li><strong>Regular Expressions and Webscraping</strong></li>
	<p>Given a set of files on car data, I used regular expressions to compile an excel with concise data such as car model, car color, VIN, location it was sold, etc. In addition, I also webscraped <a href="http://anson.ucdavis.edu/~mueller/publications.html">Professor Mueller's website.</a> We compiled a dataframe with all the authors, title of publication, year, and more. </p>
	  See the regular expression and web scrapping techniques <a href="https://kazhen.github.io/STA141A/hw4.pdf">here</a>.
	<p></p>
	<li><strong>Mapping of Data on University of California Campuses</strong></li>
	<p>With the University of California schools, I used Rgooglemaps, maps, and ggmap packages to get the distance apart the campuses are and plotted bike routes between the campuses. </p>
