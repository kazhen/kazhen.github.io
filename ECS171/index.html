	<li><strong>Sabermetrics: Predicting Games Won in a Season</strong></li>
	  <p>In a team of 15 students, we predicted the number of wins a Major League Baseball team would have in a season. Since baseball has a lot of predictors, we first found the best model and did Principal Component Analysis. Furthermore, we did classification using Nuetral Networks. Different types of regression was utilized to find prediction and prediction errors.</p>
