		<p>STA 138 does analysis on categorical data, cross-classifications, contingency tables, and more. We use log-linear models, maximum likelihood estimations, goodness of fit and logistic models. The analysis is done in R. </p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Analysis of 2 different datasets</strong></li>
	<p></p>
  <ol>
      <li> <strong>Does treatment success depend on year and group?</strong> </li>
	  <p>In this analysis, we were given a dataset of patients in group A and B, Year 1 or 2 for treatment, and the success of treatment. Through our analysis, we saw the year and group did not affect success. </p>
	  <p></p>	
	<li> <strong> Does the type of horror film death relate to character's gender? </strong></li>
  	  <p>With the dataset given, we tested to see if death and gender are dependent. After using Pearson's test for independence, we concluded that blunt force trauma and stabbing are independent of gender but males get shot more than females.</p>
	  See the detailed analysis <a href="https://kazhen.github.io/STA138/STA138Project1.pdf">here</a>.
	<p></p>
  </ol>
	<li><strong>Will a customer buy a new car based on current cars age?</strong></li>
	<p>Given a dataset with the current age of a car in months and if a customer successfully purchased a new car when visiting a car dealership, I used logistic regression to create a model. This model predicts the chances of a successful purchase of a car. Knowing this information will help car deals predict the chances of a customer buying a car.</p>
	  The model and results can be found <a href="https://kazhen.github.io/STA138/STA138Project2.pdf">here</a>.
