		<p>STA 141A is an introduction to data analysis and visualization using R. The data analysis included clean and complex data. With complex data, we cleaned the data using regular expressions. Some of the projects from this course can be seen below. </p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Analysis 2 differnet datasets</strong></li>
  <ol>
      <li> <strong>Does treatment success depend on year and group?</strong> </li>
      <li> <strong> Does the type of horror film death relate to character's gender? </strong></li>
  	  <p>Doomsday Algorithm was implemented in Python to count the number of Friday the 13's and to analyze the occurances of birthdays in 1978</p>
	  See the algorithm and analysis <a href="https://kazhen.github.io/STA138/STA138Project1.pdf">here</a>.

  </ol>
	<li><strong>Will a customer buy a new car based on current cars age?</strong></li>
	<p>Given a dataset with the current age of a car in months and if a customer successfully purchased a new car when visiting a car dealership, I used logistic regression to create a model. This model predicts the chances of a successful purchase of a car. Knowing this information will help car deals predict the chances of a customer buying a car.</p>
	  The model and results can be found <a href="https://kazhen.github.io/STA138/STA138Project2.pdf">here</a>.
